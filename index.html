                    <p>Hey! I'm Andrew! One of the most difficult decisions in my life was deciding to leave a comfortable, somewhat stable job to pursue a dream of mine, not knowing if I was going to succeed. That's never stopped me during my life though! 
                    If someone tells me I can not do something, I'm most certainly going to try, and bring with me all of the tenacity I have. This trait of mine has helped me tremendously. While in college to recieve my B.S. in Kinesiology, a teacher
                    once told me that I'd never make it as a trainer, or have a career in sports medicine, because I was too shy. Which was the truth, I am introverted, and at the time, wasn't very fond of social interaction. That same week I applied and was accepted as a trainer
                    for The Pennsylvania State University. It was uncomfortable for me, however, I was able to rid myself of that introverted side through sheer will.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a sense, that teacher was right. Even though I studied hard and recieved my CSCS (Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist), I wouldn't make it as a Kinesiologist. The reason was, my heart was in Computer Science, developing and working with and on computers.
                        I was lucky enough to start out as an intern as a  Linux Administrator, where I worked and studied hard enough to recieve a job offer at the end of the internship. I currenlty love my job as a Linux Systems Administrator. I still work hard to study, and keep up/be on par with my fellow team, 
                        but the transition was worth it! I want to extend my knowledge to those around me and help them in any way I can with computer science. The trainer in me will never leave, and I will always want to help people.
                    </p>
                    <p>In my free time (who has that anymore?!) I like to play games, and work gaining more knowledge in the development and systems administration department. I'm still very active, exercising 6 days a week. I believe this is one of the better habits that I have! I also try to talk to knew people everyday, because
                        being social to me is a skill that without practice, can degrade. Working at a desk all day behind a screen doesn't provide a lot of in-person interaction after all!
                    </p>
                    <p>I have some lofty goals that I am working towards. Firstly, I want to work my way up to be a Senior Systems Administratror, and is my main motivation for studying hard. I also want to create. This is why I started to work on development in my spare time. I want to produce something that will be shared by thousands of people. The app I want to create still eludes me, but I have this end game of creating something magnificent.
                        I also have a desire to improve the live of others, and help them through tough times. This leads me to my last two goals. I want to teach people, and give them the hope I had when switching careers. I want to teach the knowledge I've gained, I have given myself 10 years, but that could come sooner if I feel I've learned fast enough. I also want to stream,
                        so I can influence people around the world! It's ambitious, but I believe I can do it!
